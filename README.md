# Object Detection Car Controlled by Android Application

A Wi-Fi-enabled, remote-controlled car with obstacle detection using an ESP32 microcontroller, HC-SR04 ultrasonic sensor, and an Android application. The car navigates safely by detecting obstacles within 60 cm and can be controlled via a smartphone app over Wi-Fi using HTTP requests.

Developed as a group project by Soumen Mishra, Nabanita Maity, Triyasa Dey, Pousali Pal, and Anirudha Roy at Dasnagar Government Polytechnic, this project demonstrates skills in IoT, embedded systems, and Android development.

## Features
- **Obstacle Detection**: Detects objects within 60 cm using an HC-SR04 ultrasonic sensor and automatically reverses/stops to avoid collisions.
- **Wi-Fi Control**: Controlled remotely via an Android app over a Wi-Fi network created by the ESP32.
- **Real-Time Response**: Minimal delay in command execution and sensor feedback.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Simple app interface for movement controls (forward, backward, left, right, stop).
- **Collision Prevention**: Ensures safe navigation in robotic applications.
