# Introduction

The Object Detection Car Controlled by Android Application is a Wi-Fi-enabled, remote-controlled vehicle designed for collision prevention and reliable navigation. It uses an ESP32 microcontroller to create a Wi-Fi access point, allowing a smartphone app to send movement commands via HTTP requests. An HC-SR04 ultrasonic sensor detects obstacles within 60 cm, enabling the car to take corrective actions (e.g., reverse and stop) to avoid collisions.

This project, developed by Soumen Mishra, Nabanita Maity, Triyasa Dey, Pousali Pal, and Anirudha Roy, addresses the need for safe navigation in robotic systems, offering a cost-effective and scalable solution for applications like automated vehicles and security robots.
