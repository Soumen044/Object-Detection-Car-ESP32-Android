# Conclusion

The Object Detection Car project successfully achieved remote control via a smartphone app over Wi-Fi, with real-time obstacle detection using an HC-SR04 sensor. The ESP32-based system provided reliable navigation and collision prevention, addressing challenges in embedded systems, Wi-Fi networking, and Android development.

Key learnings include:
- Integration of sensors with microcontrollers.
- Wi-Fi communication using HTTP protocols.
- Android app development for IoT applications.

The project offers a practical solution for safe robotic navigation, with potential for further enhancements.
